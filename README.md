  <h3 align="center">Tiktok Live Game</h3>

</div>

## <a name="introduction">ðŸ¤– Introduction</a>

I was inspired to start this project after watching a fascinating game on YouTube, developed by "Franks laboratory." The concept intrigued me, and I decided to take the idea one step further. By combining it with the TikTok-Live-Connector, I aimed to create a unique gaming experience where a ship shoots at players. In this game, people in the TikTok chat can interact with the game in real-time, influencing the gameplay and making it more engaging and dynamic.

Please note that the game is still a work in progress and requires additional development to reach its full potential.

In the future, I may fix some issues and add more features to enhance the gameplay experience.

A special thanks to "Franks laboratory" for his inspiring work.
